12/3/2016:
Worked @GA-
-Sam and Jon divided and calibrated what front end responsibilities they'd take
while I focused on nesting CRUD on the back-end
-Finished defining full CRUD for Songs model
-Created files pertaining to Songs model CRUD and also had two different files
for the beginning of nesting 'possible_app.js, possible-index.js'
--Messaged the group my code at the end of my session so could collaborate on my
work and get their feedback on my direction, hoping that I followed the defined
ideas we had
